ActiveModel::StateMachine
=========================

I believe this was pulled from Rails 3 at the last minute, not much documentation exists, but it works very nicely.

Add this line to your bundle:

    gem 'state_machine', :git => 'git://github.com/ivanvanderbyl/state_machine.git', :require => 'active_model/state_machine'
